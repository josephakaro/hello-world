# About Me 🧑🏾

I am an avid technology enthusiast who loves to explore and discover new ways of leveraging technology for the betterment of society. I have a passion for coding and troubleshooting problems with electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and digital TVs. With my knowledge and experience, I have been able to help friends out with their tech issues - from fixing computer viruses to setting up WIFI networks. 

My determination to learn more about technology is also what drives me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry, including ``artificial intelligence (AI)`` and ``machine learning (ML)``.
